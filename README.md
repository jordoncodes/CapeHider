# CapeHider | A simple Spigot plugin to hide all capes

## Requirements:
- [Nicknamer API](https://github.com/jordoncodes/nicknamer-api), which needs [PacketEvents](https://github.com/retrooper/packetevents).

This makes it possibly incompatible with other nicknaming plugins, unless they use/support Nicknamer API

## Permissions:
- capehider.togglecape - /togglecape command (permission does nothing by itself)
- capehider.togglecape.self - allows for you to toggle your own cape using /togglecape (requires capehider.togglecape)
- capehider.togglecape.self - allows for you to toggle other people's capes using /togglecape (requires capehider.togglecape)
- capehider.bypass - makes it so the plugin does not disable your cape.
